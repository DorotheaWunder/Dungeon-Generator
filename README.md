# Dungeon Generator

An application that generates a randomized  dungeon by combining *Prim’s algorithm* and a variation of *Poisson distribution*.

## The Maze
In the first step, the dungeon generator creates a maze of corridors by using *Prim’s algorithm*.

## The Rooms
In the second generation step, the dungeon generator picks a selection of semi-randomized tiles from the map and generates a room around those anchor tiles.
